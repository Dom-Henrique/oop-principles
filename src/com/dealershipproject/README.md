# DEALERSHIP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - TERMINAL
Since that i've started my Computer Science degree, Java sparked my curiosity about Object Oriented Programming. My friends from 2nd period developed a terminal system to dealerships manage your sales, your cars or motobikes and have notion about your customers. Due to this, i created this project obeying the class relationships and applying good practices.

# Technologies

I recommend to you the IDE [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) from JetBrains, but you are free to use an IDE from your taste.

Into your terminal, write this code:

Wait some seconds and this project will be created into your computer.
